# SEEI Community Guidelines

This document outlines various guidelines for the SEEI community.  It is *not*
a comprehensive Code of Conduct, but a roadmap for community participation.  
This is a living document and we expect it to evolve significantly.  Feel
free to send a pull request if you feel like something should change.

## Purpose

We are a community designed to develop and disseminate various Software
Engineering education content which can be used by faculty in Software
Engineering courses.  This content can be used as part of existing course
curriculum, or as a base to develop new curriculum.  We feel that having a
quick test-and-release cycle and strong industry-academia feedback will help
provide the best experience for students preparing to enter industry as
software engineers.

## Interaction

We desire to allow as many people as possible to contribute to and consume this
content.  Given that our community spans the globe, across institutions and
timezones, it is important that decisions are publicly archived and available
for review.  To that end, we try to follow these guidelines when interacting:

 * All decisions and meeting minutes are recorded in the github repository.
 * Binding discussion happens on the [public mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/softwareengineeringeducationinitiative).

Finally, we recognize that we are individuals and there will be differences of
opinion between members of the community.  Please respect those whose
viewpoints may differ from your own and treat others as the professionals we
are.
