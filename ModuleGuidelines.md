# Guidelines
- Level:
-- Introductory, Intermediate, Advanced
-- Basically, we can mark each part of the module to be one of these. Or maybe if aÂ level is not set, it is introductory by default.
-- Advanced may be either scientific/under-research studies or really deep technical explanations of the technology or the module.
- Good practices
-- Best way to teach with real concrete examples
-- Like how to start, follow the module etc.
- Bad practices
-- Things to avoid while teaching this module with real concrete examples (if possible)
- What happens in the absence of this module?
-- This is more like what do we lose if we don't adopt this in our development.
- Tool support
-- Possible open source tools around
-- Possible commercial tools around
- Active learning materials
- Assignments/Homeworks/Projects
-- Real industry oriented examples
-- Titus and Hyrum may be good connections on that
- Exam-based assessment materials
- Papers
-- Either very common/famous/bext ones about the topic or about teaching the topic
- Further resources
-- Youtube videos, online courses, presentations, podcasts etc.
- Prerequisite
-- If exists
- References


## Notes
- No repeating of the same material creation. If the creators of the module agrees to reuse a good existing one, it will do it but maybe enriching according to the guideline here.
- Good/bad practices of the module content will already be inside the module. Here the good/bad practices is about teaching the topic.
- Industry perspective on any part of the module can be reviewed/added by industry-experienced people in our group
