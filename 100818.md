## Agenda
* Welcome
* Introductions
* Name, affiliation, why you are here (60 seconds please!)

## Vision
* What are we trying to accomplish?

There are a lack of materials when it comes to teaching SE.

There are many practices that are core to SE, but they are not being taught effectively. 

SE != Computer Science, and students need to be taught SE in addition to knowing Computer Science

How can we help improve collaboration between Software Engineering Practitioners and Educators

How can we work together to create materials that can be used in different settings around the world. 

Why work on this collaboratively?  

No one person has the answers.  

Many people are constrained in that they cannot re-build an entire curriculum.

By building modules that are sized to 1-2 class lectures, we can slot them in to existing courses faster.  

How are we going to accomplish that?

## Module development

Long run: what should software engineering curriculum be?

Short run: build concrete modules that can be applied insight of existing courses and iterate on those quickly.

Not many materials out there to borrow

Building a much more complete package than just a set of slides

* Slides
* Learning exercises
* Content

Working groups to help come up with modules as

Perhaps teach them this fall and give feedback

Modules can slot into existing courses

Sarah: How do we create the groups who are going to build the modules?

Eventually discover what modules should look like, and build a framework for creating them.

What about grad-level courses?

The principles are probably the same for undergrads and grads, but the specific examples might be different.

We don’t want to replace professors. We want to provide material to help Professors be the best that they can be.

An example of something that many people learn on the job is code review. Can we help undergrads learn code review better, 
so they don’t have to “learn on the job”.

How do we get these topics to “stick”?  Students need to want to learn these topics for this to be effective.

## Potential Module topics:
* Version control
* Automated testing
* Code review
* Specification Writing
* Writing in general
* Code smells, naming practices, code style etc ?
* Bug reporting: how to write a good bug report ?
* Pair programming



## Proposal: Module on Code Review
Potential pilots: Sarah (can help develop it in the fall but will not pilot till Jan), Mark, Julia (can help develop; teaching ~10/2018), Giuseppe, Fabio (help and teach code review class ~ Oct/2018), Eray (can help develop it in the fall but will not pilot till Jan)


## Next steps
* Invitation to collaborate
* Subscribe to the mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/softwareengineeringeducationinitiative
* Checkout the github repo: https://github.com/SoftwareEngineeringEducationInitiative
* Michael will post meeting notes after we are done
* Share widely with other interested parties
* Next meeting in ~month?
* Participate in module development!


## Action Items:
* Michael Hilton: post meeting minutes
* Everyone: Add SE courses to the github repository
* Everyone: Offline: come up with a list of what needs to be taught
