# Software Engineering Topics for potential module development

Here are a list of topics for potential modules.  While there is no expectation that all of these modules would be developed
immediately, there is broad agreement that it would be helpful to describe a set of topics that would be useful for teaching Software Engineering.
The list is divided into two sections.  Core SE topics, and other topics which are also relevent for SE education.
Please feel free to submit a PR with suggestions of topics to add.  

# Core SE Module Topics
* Version control
* Automated testing
* Code review
* Specification Writing
* Code smells, naming practices, code style etc ?
* Bug reporting: how to write a good bug report ?
* Pair programming
* Software Modeling (how much should we model? using what? when (what kind of projects)? etc.)
* Software Design/Architecture
* Software Effort Estimation
* Source code static analysis and measurement.

# Additional SE Topics
* Communication (writing)
* Technical debt (perhaps a core topic)
* Formal methods (does anyone in this group teach this topic in SE courses?)
